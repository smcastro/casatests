        VLASS 1.1 : No Pointing Corrections. MS field phasecenter is treated as the pointing center for all antennas. 
                           Image each OTF field separately (to make a scan plot)
                           Use mtmfs with conjbeams True and test pb-corrected intensity and spectral index.

        Test that the intensity and spectral index are wrong (pick known wrong values). 
        The plot should show a slope in intensity and spectral index arising from the average pointing offset
        in the majority of the antennas (ie. 20 old ACU ants) between the true pointing and the recorded phase center.

        This is the state of CASA 5.6 for usepointing=False
