2025-09-16 16:08:07	WARN	ImageCollapser::_doMultipleBeams	Input image has per plane beams but the collapse is not done exclusively along the direction axes. The output image will arbitrarily have a single beam which is the first beam available in the subimage.Thus, the image planes will not be convolved to a common restoring beam before collapsing. If, however, this is desired, then run the task imsmooth or the tool method ia.convolve2d() first, and use the output image of that as the input for collapsing.
