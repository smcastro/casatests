2025-09-16 17:18:53	WARN	sdintimaging::task_sdintimaging::casa	The Single-Dish-Only mode of sdintimaging is better supported via the deconvolve task which supports spectral cube, mfs and multi-term mfs deconvolution in the image domain alone. The deconvolve task is the more appropriate version to use for stand-alone image-domain deconvolution, and will not have the bookkeeping overheads currently present in the sdintimaging task's sd-only mode. Please note that the 'sd' option of the sdintimaging task will be removed in a subsequent release.  Please refer to the task deconvolve documentation for instructions on how to prepare image and psf cubes for the deconvolve task for all these modes.

A minimum of nterms = 2 channels is required for an accurate polynomial fit, but where possible at least 5 to 10 channels that span the frequency range are prefered in order to properly encode frequency dependent intensity and weights.
