          This test uses default Airy Disk primary beam models generated purely from the ANTENNA table's diameter column. 
          This test has a non-standard (unknown) observatory name and represents the use case of an arbitrary telescope
                  for which primary beam models are unknown and whose size is guided only by the ANTENNA subtable. 
          The simulated dataset consists of one 1Jy source. Therefore, the PB at the location of the source should match the intensity value.

          It tests the use of canned ALMA primary beam models in heterogeneous array imaging mode.

        CAS-13074, verify that coord=ICRS works correctly

        1. Create a 100x100 image using the default coordinate system provided by ia.shape()

        2. Modify the coordinate system of the image from J2000 to GALACTIC ref frame,
           since the difference between J2000 and ICRS seems to be only about 10 marcsec,
           so we need to use a coordinate system where the values in the two systems differ
           more to get a convincing test.

        3. Set all pixels to 0, except the reference pixel 50, 50 which is set to 1.

        4. Create a CRTF region string using coords='ICRS' and a box that is centered at
           GALACTIC long=0, lat=0 (the ref direction in the image) but using ICRS coords
           of course. The hardcoded ICRS coords were determined using me.measure() to
           convert from GALACTIC to ICRS.

        5. Run ia.statistics() using region=the CRTF text string previously created.

        6. Test that the max pixel value found in the region is 1. This indicates that
           the region was applied correctly.

          Run a sequence of tclean runs to trigger a complicated situation of restarts, mixing serial/parallel and model writes. 
          This sequence, coupled with the algorithm options listed below in tests #1 through #6 trigger three different errors that
          have been fixed in this branch, and one that will be addressed via CAS-9386 (cube refactor). 

          tclean call sequence : 
          --- (a) Parallel run for niter=0
          --- (b) Serial/Parallel run for niter=10, with calcres=F, calcpsf=F  : to reuse images from prev.
          --- (c) Serial model-predict run (without/with startmodel) : in one case it reuses prev image-set. in other case it reuses only 'model'. 
          --- (d) Impbcor on the output of (b)

          Note that this is not a full fix of the various instances of the 'latpole' inconsistency, but only a workaround. 
          Hence it needs a test to ensure this keeps working.

                           Use mtmfs with conjbeams True and test pb-corrected intensity and spectral index.
                           Image both integrations in each scan.

        Test that the intensity and spectral index are wrong. Antenna clustering is applied, but time dependence it not.
        
        If the second timestep is included (or chosen) the slope re-appears
        because with psf=[x,300], the pointing offset is read only from the first timestep in a VLASS scan.

        This is a redundant test.  It need not be included in stakeholder verification tests, but is useful to illustrate
        an effect.

        For CAS-14409, introduce test of callibrary specified in different ways, but to achieve
        the same thing.   We copy 2 spws from gaincaltest2.ms, and adjust the intents (defintent) 
        to be more typically ALMA-like; multiple redundant intents (e.g., many OBSERVE_TARGET intents
        in separate STATE_IDs) is a prerequisite for tickling the bug reported in CAS-14409, which
        was caused by effectively non-unique matching of data encountered in applycal with the
        keys used to index different slices of calibration specified by the cal library.
        
        In CAS-14409, a (WARN) log message has also been introduced to help users recognize when
        calibration application encounters data not explicitly or implicitly catered for in the
        net cal library (per caltable).  This is a supported feature (such data should pass 
        uncorrected by the caltable so specified), but it was thought desirable to have a more 
        explicit acknowledgment in the logger that some data wasn't corrected.

          Run a sequence of tclean runs to trigger a complicated situation of restarts, mixing serial/parallel and model writes. 
          This sequence, coupled with the algorithm options listed below in tests #1 through #6 trigger three different errors that
          have been fixed in this branch, and one that will be addressed via CAS-9386 (cube refactor). 

          tclean call sequence : 
          --- (a) Parallel run for niter=0
          --- (b) Serial/Parallel run for niter=10, with calcres=F, calcpsf=F  : to reuse images from prev.
          --- (c) Serial model-predict run (without/with startmodel) : in one case it reuses prev image-set. in other case it reuses only 'model'. 
          --- (d) Impbcor on the output of (b)

          Note that this is not a full fix of the various instances of the 'latpole' inconsistency, but only a workaround. 
          Hence it needs a test to ensure this keeps working.
