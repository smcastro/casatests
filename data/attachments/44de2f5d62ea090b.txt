2025-09-16 16:25:32	WARN	imregrid::::casa	You've specified that you want to regrid the spectral axis without specifying the output shape. Normally the length chosen would be that of the corresponding template axis, however, the template spectral axis is degenerate and one cannot regrid an axis such that its output length is one. So, removing axis 3 from the axes list and just copying the input spectral information to the output image
