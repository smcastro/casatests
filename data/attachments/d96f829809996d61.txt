2025-09-16 17:34:47	SEVERE	ms::statwt	Exception Reported: Exception: The WEIGHT_SPECTRUM and/or SIGMA_SPECTRUM columnS did not exist in this MS but it/they has now been created and initialized. However, due to a known issue in the code, statwt cannot correctly construct and write back these columns for the subset of the MS specified by data selection. A work-around is to simply re-run statwt again (on the MS that now contains a properly initialized columns), specifying the same selection criteria. If you are using the tool method, first close the ms tool, then reopen it using the same data set, apply the same selection, and then run ms.statwt(). If you are using the task, simply rerunning it with the same inputs should be sufficient.
