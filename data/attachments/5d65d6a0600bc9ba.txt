2025-09-16 14:57:06	WARN	ImageRegrid::regrid	You are regridding an image whose beam is not well sampled by the pixel size.  Total flux can be lost when regridding such images, especially when the new pixel size is larger than the old pixel size. It is recommended to check the total flux of your input and output image, and if necessary rebin the input to have smaller pixels.
