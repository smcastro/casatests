2025-09-16 17:13:21	WARN	sdintimaging::task_sdintimaging::casa	The Single-Dish-Only mode of sdintimaging is better supported via the deconvolve task which supports spectral cube, mfs and multi-term mfs deconvolution in the image domain alone. The deconvolve task is the more appropriate version to use for stand-alone image-domain deconvolution, and will not have the bookkeeping overheads currently present in the sdintimaging task's sd-only mode. Please note that the 'sd' option of the sdintimaging task will be removed in a subsequent release.  Please refer to the task deconvolve documentation for instructions on how to prepare image and psf cubes for the deconvolve task for all these modes.

It is recommended to check the total flux of your input and output image, and if necessary rebin the input to have smaller pixels.
