2025-09-16 15:32:43	WARN	tclean::task_tclean::casa	For specmode='mfs' and deconvolver='mtmfs', the option of pbcor=True divides each restored Taylor coefficient image by the pb.tt0 image. This correction ignores the frequency-dependence of the primary beam and does not correct for PB spectral index. It is scientifically valid only for small fractional bandwidths. For more accurate wideband primary beam correction (if needed), please use one of the following options : (1) specmode='mvc' with gridder='standard' or 'mosaic' with pbcor=True,  (2) conjbeams=True and wbawp=True with gridder='awproject' and pbcor=True.

If you are attempting to restart a run with a new image shape, please change imagename and supply the old model or mask as inputs (via the startmodel or mask parameters) so that they can be regridded to the new shape before continuing.
