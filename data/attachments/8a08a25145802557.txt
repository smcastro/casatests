2025-09-16 14:56:53	SEVERE	image::_casaQuantityFromVar (file src/tools/image/image_cmpt.cc, line 6869)	Exception Reported: The input image shape ([200, 200, 1, 20]) and mask shape ([200, 200, 1, 1]) are different, and it was specified that the mask should not be extended, so the mask cannot be applied to the (sub)image. Specifying that the mask should be extended may resolve the issue at File: /source/casainstall/include/casacpp/imageanalysis/ImageAnalysis/SubImageFactory.tcc, line: 306
